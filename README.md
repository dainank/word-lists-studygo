#  StudyGo Wordlists
> Collection of word lists to learn languages.

## Usage
> Lists can be **directly imported** into _StudyGo_.

All lists are available under [`./lists` directory]().

> You can verify duplicate entries by searching the repository for more than one reference of a word:

At some point, this will be automatically checked on push.

## Supported Languages
