Grammer of the Verb
===================

A verb is _said to be conjugated_ with the following _variables_:
    - **person** (aimes/aimons): I like / we love
    - **tense** (veut/voulut): to want/wanted
    - **mood** (envoya/envoyât): did send/should send
    - **aspect** (connut/connaissait): 
    - **voice** (vendu / s'est vendu / a été vendu):

The **tables of conjugation** set out the variants that can be created from the above variables.

Three groups of verbs exist:
    - **-er** (Infinitive) / **-e** (1st-person of présent indicative)
    - **-ir** (Infinitive) / **-is** (1st-person of présent indicative) / **-issant** (present participle)
    - Other verbs (becoming extinct):
        - **aller**
        - **-ir** where indicative does not end in **-is** nor present in **-issant**
        - **-oir**, **-re**

- Plus-que-parfait  - **Actions before another past action** (`J'avais fini avant lui - I had finished before him, Elle était partie quand je suis arrivé - She had left when I arrived`)

### Subjunctive Mood
> Expressing subjective ideas, possibilities and desires.

- Présent   - Used after verbs like 'vouloir, demander, il est possible que'
    - `Je veux qu'il vienne - I want him to come`
    - `On ne sait pas s'il ait raison - We don't know if he's right`
- Passé     - Used to express hypothetical situations/regrets
    - `Si j'avais su, je ne l'aurais pas fait - If I had known, I wouldn't have done it`

### Additional Tenses & Moods

Tenses:
- Passé simple: Used in formal writing for past actions, similar to the passé composé.
- Futur antérieur: Used in complex future constructions.
- Conditionnel: Used for hypothetical situations and polite requests.

Moods:
- Imperative Mood
    - Used for giving orders, instructions, or requests.
    - Doesn't use pronouns (I, you, etc.) directly.
    - Example: `Chantez une chanson ! (Sing a song!)` - This is a direct command.
- Conditional Mood
    - Used for hypothetical situations, polite requests, and expressing uncertainty.
    - Often formed by adding "`-rais`" or "`-rait`" to the verb stem.
    - Example: `"Je cherais une chanson si j'avais une voix plus belle." (I would sing a song if I had a better voice.)` - This expresses a hypothetical situation.
- Infinitive Mood
    - Used as a noun or modifier, not a complete sentence.
    - Often used after verbs like "`pouvoir`" (to be able to), "`vouloir`" (to want), and "`falloir`" (to be necessary).
    - Example: `"J'aime chanter." (I like to sing.)` - This infinitive modifies "aimer".

## Aspect
> Focuses on the action's **completeness, duration or internal structure**.

- `J'ai fini mon devoir. (I have finished my homework)` - Passé composé emphasizes completion.
- `Je lisais un livre quand il est arrivé. (I was reading a book when he arrived)` - Imparfait indicates ongoing action.
- `Il travaille depuis des heures. (He has been working for hours)` - The present tense with "depuis" suggests sustained duration.
- `Je vais manger la pizza toute seule. (I'm going to eat the pizza all by myself)` - "aller" + infinitive creates a future intention with ongoing action.

## Voice
> The relationship between the **subject**, **verb** and **object** in a sentence, indicating who/what performs the action expressed by the verb and whether the action directly affects another entity.

- Active Voice      - Subject **performs** action directly on object.
- Passive Voice     - Subject **receives** action performed by agent. [Less Frequent]
- Pronominal Voice:
    - Subject **performs** action on itself and direct other object - `Il se lave les mains. (He washes his hands.)` - He (subject) is performing the action of washing on his own hands (object).
    - Indirectly on itself  - `Elles s'embrassent. (They kiss each other.) - Each person (subject) acts on both themselves and the other person (object indirectly).`
